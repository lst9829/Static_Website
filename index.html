    <h1>Cities I've Lived In</h1>
    <div>
      <p>
        I was born and raised in Shelter Island, NY for most of my life. I spent 18 years there before I went off 
        to college. I lived in East Stroudsburg, PA for a few years and attended East Stroudsburg University until 
        school got too expensive to continue. Then I lived with my wife and her family for a year in Bethlehem, PA
        for about a year while I was waiting to go to basic training for the Air Force. Finally, I got stationed in 
        Great Falls, MT where I've lived for my entire career.

    <h1>Cities I Want To Visit</h1>
    <div>
      <p>
        I would love to visit Charleston, SC because oneof my good friends is from there and always said it was
        beautiful. San Fransico has been a place I've wanted to visit because there is so much to see and I'm a 
        big baseball fan and Oracle Park has always seemed really amazing. Finally, I'd like to visit Seattle because
        I'm a big Dave Grohl and Foo Fighters fan and I think it would be pretty cool to visit the birthplace of
        Grunge.
